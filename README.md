## Fonts

The logo uses the [Rajdhani](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rajdhani?query=Rajdhani) font. 
For consistency, stick to sans-serif fonts.

## Logos

**Note:** There are two versions of the SVG files available:

1. The first version represents each character as a text character.
2. The second version represents each character as a path.

In production, it is recommended to use the path version. This choice is made because the text character version relies on the presence of specific fonts being installed. To avoid unnecessary bandwidth usage, please do not bundle the font with the files. **As a consiquence of this, the logo will render incorrectly without the font being installed.**

The purpose of retaining the text version is to ensure future compatibility, should the need arise to import the SVG into a graphics package.

Please see the [logos](https://github.com/LUCompSoc/brand/tree/master/logos) folder for files.
